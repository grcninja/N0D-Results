# N0D-Results
Contains the Domain Name and corresponding IP address for malicious sites
The source for the domains is listed at http://mirror1.malwaredomains.com/files/domains.txt.  
The N0D code parses the domain names and looks up the current IP address at the time of the inquiry.  It should be noted that sites come up and go down within a few days or even hours sometimes.  So this information is current as of the time of the inquiry which is normally between 1-3 hours before it is posted here.  
These files in this directory are the results.
